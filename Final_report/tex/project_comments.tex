Overall, the project was very educative. What was a welcome observation was that none of the suggested topics on the course were fully in the comfort zone of the group members. All of the given topics included plenty of areas of signal processing and machine learning that were completely new to the group members, which forced the participants to choose a topic that contained lots of uncertainty. To our experience, this turned out to be a clear advantage, since the present project taught each group member a lot about different areas that are completely new to the group.

In addition to the challenges that implementing the project provided, the course gave a good insight on project management and teamwork coordination. The course also gave some hands-on experience on how some things might be done in working life, such as planning the timetable and estimating the budget of the project.

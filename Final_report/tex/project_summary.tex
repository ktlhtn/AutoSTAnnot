\section{Project organization}

The project members were Einari Vaaras, Mehmet Aydin and Kalle Lahtinen. The open tasks related to the project were discussed on a daily basis in a project-specific Telegram channel. Before the project, there were no predefined roles for the project members, and the aim was to divide weekly tasks based on open discussion and equal contribution. During the project, each group member specialized in different categories of the project. Einari handled parts related to audio powermaps, beamforming, bounding box cleaning, mapping class labels. Mehmet specialized in experimenting with the recording devices such as providing test-scenes-to-be-experimented with on a weekly basis. Additionally, he studied about tracking methods and their implementations, especially Deep Sort (reference here!). Kalle took care of the video object detection pipeline, as well as defining a standardized CSV file output and producing audio event detections based on audio powermaps. In problematic situations such as code debugging, all group members participated in helping the group. In addition, course-related activities such as writing reports and planning presentations were carried out by all group members. Furthermore, all group members participated in the final recordings for the project, which are further discussed in Section \ref{sec_implementation_steps}.

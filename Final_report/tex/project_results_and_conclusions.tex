The main goal of the project was to get a working pipeline for automatically generating spatiotemporal labels for audio events, and the project group managed to get two functioning pipelines for the task successfully. As an outcome, a GitHub repository containing all source codes that were created during the project was created together with a thorough documentation of how the provided codes can be used for the task. Overall, the project provided valuable insight into the topics of object detection for 360-degree videos and spatial sound recognition for both the group members and the clients. However, as listed in Section \ref{sec_future_development_needs}, there are multiple areas of the project that can be vastly improved. Perhaps one of the main outcomes of the project was to gain knowledge for the clients of what is currently working and what is not, and what are the limitations of the current pipelines and the equipment that was used.

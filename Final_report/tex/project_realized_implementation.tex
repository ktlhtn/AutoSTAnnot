\section{Future Development Needs}

Implementation should be tested more vigorously: more recordings, testing the produced data in actual training

trying out the system with a microphone array with a better spatial resolution: audio powermap can be improved

making the pipeline end-to-end

adding more intelligent object tracking methods

improving the video detector: more objects, better recognition, more carefully designing scenes so that objects are better detected (not very close to the camera)

\section{Project members}

The project members are Einari Vaaras, Mehmet Aydin and Kalle Lahtinen. There are no defined roles for the project members. The open tasks related to the project are discussed daily in a project-specific Telegram-channel. The workload is divided within the group on a weekly basis using a democratic decision making process in which open discussion and equality are emphasized. The goal of the project is to achieve concrete results in a way that every group member gets to participate and learn something new.

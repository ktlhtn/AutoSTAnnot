There are multiple resources available for the project. For video object detection and tracking, there are multiple
readymade implementations available for state-of-the-art models. The same applies for many of the audio-related
tasks of the project. Furthermore, the clients are experts in audio processing and they are able to provide useful
insights throughout the project. There is also lots of video and image processing expertise at the university, so it
is possible to ask help from some expert in those fields.

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the work will be mostly conducted remotely. However, the recording process needs to be
performed in different locations determined by the group members. For these recording sessions, a 360 camera with an
integrated microphone array will be provided by the university.

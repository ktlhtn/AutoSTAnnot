\section{Implementation}

The tasks listed in the project objectives chapter will be further divided into smaller subtasks here to give a more detailed desicription of the tasks and what are the steps to complete the planned tasks. 

\section{Project initialization and planning (basic)}

\section{Preliminary study of open source video detection methods that could be applied in the project (basic)}

\section{Designing the scenes that are to be recorded using a 360 video camera and the integrated microphone array (basic)}

\section{Recording the designed scenes (basic)}

\section{Developing a set of python scripts for handling the video data frames (basic data handling methods for video) (basic)}

\section{Developing a set of python scripts for applying object detection for the video data frames (basic)}

\section{Developing a method for outputting the detected visual objects, their locations and the time interval of detection to be used together with spatial audio detection (basic)}

\section{Testing the developed video handling scripts with the recorded video data (basic)}

\section{Developing a method for outputting the detected sound events, their locations and the time interval of detection to be used together with spatial audio detection (basic)}

\section{Manually mapping visual object labels with the sound event labels to be used for automated annotation (basic)}

\section{Documenting (this includes the final report and the presentations) (basic)}

\section{Testing the method against manual annotation (basic)}

\section{Designing more complicated scenes to be recorded and testing the system with them (advanced)}

\section{Further developing the video detection part of the application so that different detection models could be used dynamically (as configured by the user)(advanced)}

\section{Testing if the use of tracking algorithms could be used to further improve the accuracy of the application (if needed) (advanced)}

\section{Developing a graphical user interface for the mapping of visual object labels and sound event labels (advanced)}
